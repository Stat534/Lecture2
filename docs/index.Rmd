## Git Resources

- Git will feel foreign for a while, but you will get a lot of practice in this class

- A great resource, from which I've heavily borrowed is Jenny Bryan's [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com)

- Another good reference is the [GitHub Git Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

## Git: The What and the Why
- Git is a version control system that manages as set of files as a repository, or a *repo*.

- For the long version of why, see [Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/)

- For today, just know:
    - Programming expertise, and skills like this, are essential in Data Science
    - Version control will save back up files, in case of computer problems
    - It is an efficient way to handle collaboration
    - Creating R packages is easy with R Studio and github

## Demo Overview:

I acknowledge that everyone will work at different speeds today, so feel free to work ahead.

1. Github account
2. Upgrade R and R Studio
3. Git installation and initialization
4. Git GUI??
5. Git - to - Github with R Studio: access
6. Basic Git Commands


## Github Account

- At this point you should have registered for a github account.

- If not, visit [github.com](https://www.github.com) to set up your account.

- If you have an account, go ahead and log in. We will use this soon.

## R and R Studio Updates

- R is currently on version 3.5.2, if your version is much older than this, you will want to update it [here](https://cloud.r-project.org).

- Updating R can be a bit painful, but keeping current is good practice.

- R Studio is constantly adding improvements and updates, including a git interface.

- To stay current, consider using the [Preview version](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) and updating every month or so.
